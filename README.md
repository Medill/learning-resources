##Welcome Students

As we progress through the course you'll find collected here the code examples, assignments, cheat-sheets, and miscellanea that we make, break, and mend along the way to learning how to apply our new skills to the provate work you're doing to realise effective prototypes of your team projects.

###Designing with your Digits
####**WYSIWAS:** What you see is woefully, anachronistically, stale...

Someday there may be a truly [decent visual tool](http://macaw.co) for web and App design, but the one huge **CON** for anyone learning to code with markup languages is that today's tools create a barrier to learning. When you rely on a software algorithm to "write" the code, it often composes too much or too little resulting in uniquely, cluttered, human-unreadable markup. 
The fact remains that *coding* is *typing* and here writers have a leg up on the designers. Their fingers are used to the keyboard, their eyes are attuned to notice the errant `;` where a `:` is desired. When you are just starting 90% of learning to code is avoiding (or at least recognizing) the tiny typos that frustrate your efforts, but the rewards for becoming comfortable and confident with hand-coding are enormous for designers. 
There are ["one-line" Terminal commands](https://gist.github.com/andyhullinger) to batch process images that would take hours in Photoshop and simply having your content in "simple-text" form provides a type of flexibility and portability among software programs that .pdf cannot hope to match.

####Sublime Text 2 (*[download and install](http://www.sublimetext.com/)*)
Sublime Text is a sophisticated text editor for code, markup and prose. You'll love the slick user interface, extraordinary features and amazing performance.The first "package" you should install is Emmet.

####Brackets (*[download and install](http://brackets.io/)*)
Brackets doesn't get in the way of your creative process. It blends visual tools into the editor while pushing HTML and CSS to the browser as you code. The first "extension" you should install is Emmet.
